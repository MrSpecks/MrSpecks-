### Systems Administrator | Cloud Engineer | Penetration Tester | Microsoft Certified | Full-Stack Developer

Welcome to my digital corner of GitHub. I'm **MrSpecks**, a modern IT professional pushing the limits of what's possible with code, infrastructure, and security. I don't just follow trends—I test, break, build, and refine them.

- **Cloud Engineering** (Azure, AWS, Hybrid)
- **Systems Administration** (Windows & Linux)
- **Penetration Testing & Red Team Recon** (Offensive Security)
- **Web & Systems Development** (Full-stack, APIs, Automation)

## What I'm Building

Right now, I’m exploring projects that combine **recon automation**, **tech stack fingerprinting**, and **adaptive payload delivery** — like my new tool:  
**[NeoShell](https://github.com/MrSpecks/NeoShell)**  
A 90s-inspired, future-ready recon and webshell deployment tool for authorized red team assessments.

## Vision

> *“To become a fearless, well-rounded IT leader with a command of systems, security, and innovation that empowers communities and disrupts limitations.”*

I'm on a journey to shape the future of tech — from the **terminal to the cloud**, and from **code to culture**.
